## üîß JavaScript Code Generation Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Agent Returns Generic Response Instead of JavaScript Code
**Solution**: Be more specific in your request
- ‚ùå "Create JavaScript code for UPS"
- ‚úÖ "Generate a Node.js function for UPS package tracking using fetch API"

#### Issue: Agent Generates Python Instead of JavaScript
**Solution**: Explicitly mention JavaScript in the query
- ‚ùå "Create code for UPS shipping"
- ‚úÖ "Create JavaScript code for UPS shipping label creation"

#### Issue: Code is Too Generic or Incomplete
**Solution**: Request specific components
- ‚ùå "JavaScript UPS integration"
- ‚úÖ "JavaScript function to authenticate with UPS API and create shipping label"

### Backup JavaScript Queries for Demo

1. **Simple Authentication**:
   ```
   "Create a JavaScript function for UPS API authentication using fetch"
   ```

2. **Package Tracking**:
   ```
   "Generate Node.js code for UPS package tracking with error handling"
   ```

3. **Shipping Label**:
   ```
   "Create a JavaScript SDK function for UPS shipping label creation"
   ```

4. **Complete Example**:
   ```
   "Show me a complete JavaScript example for UPS shipping integration with authentication"
   ```

### Demo Recovery Script

**If JavaScript generation fails**:
- "Let me try a more specific approach..."
- "The agent works best with detailed requests..."
- "Let me show you a simpler JavaScript example first..."
- "This demonstrates the importance of clear, specific queries..."
