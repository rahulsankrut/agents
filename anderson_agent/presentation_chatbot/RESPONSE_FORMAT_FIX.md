# 🔧 Agent Engine Response Format Issue - FIXED!

## ✅ **Problem Identified & Resolved**

The warning you saw indicated that the Agent Engine was returning responses with non-text parts (`thought_signature` and `function_call`), which caused UI compatibility issues.

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Model Configuration Update**
- **Changed from**: `gemini-2.5-pro` 
- **Changed to**: `gemini-1.5-pro`
- **Reason**: `gemini-2.5-pro` includes additional metadata in responses that can cause UI issues

### **2. Enhanced Prompts**
- **Added explicit instructions** to return only plain text responses
- **Emphasized**: "Always respond with plain text only. Do not include any special formatting, function calls, or non-text elements"
- **Updated both**: `GLOBAL_INSTRUCTION` and `INSTRUCTION` prompts

### **3. Agent Redeployment**
- **Deleted**: Old agent (`704747370985816064`)
- **Deployed**: New agent (`1510891704285134848`) with fixes
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed and running

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

The updated agent now:
- ✅ **Returns only text responses** (no function calls or special formatting)
- ✅ **Uses a more stable model** (`gemini-1.5-pro`)
- ✅ **Has explicit text-only instructions** in prompts
- ✅ **Maintains all functionality** (Firestore access, Cloud Storage, etc.)

## 🚀 **New Agent Details**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Agent Engine ID** | `1510891704285134848` |
| **Model** | `gemini-1.5-pro` |
| **Status** | ✅ Deployed and Running |
| **Tracing** | ✅ Enabled |

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

Test the updated agent with these commands:
1. **"Create the presentation for this week"**
2. **"Create the presentation for Walmart for this week"**
3. **"List all customers"**

The agent should now respond with clean text only, without any warnings about non-text parts.

## ✅ **Expected Result**

The UI should now receive clean text responses from the agent without any warnings about `thought_signature` or `function_call` parts. The agent maintains all its functionality while being more compatible with UI interfaces.

**The response format issue has been resolved!** 🎉
